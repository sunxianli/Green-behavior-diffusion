# Green-behavior-diffusion-with-positive-and-negative-information-in-time-varying-multiplex-networks
This repository contains the scripts and data from the " Green behavior diffusion with positive and negative information in time-varying multiplex networks " by Xianli Sun, Linghua Zhang, Qiqing Zhai, and Peng Zheng. 

INSTRUCTIONS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
The code for the simulation is written in MATLAB, using version 2021a and requires no add-ons. All the functions needed are included in the corresponding folders. Hence, to run the code it is sufficient to open the corresponding folder with MATLAB.

ORGANIZATION:
This project contains the scripts and data that can be divided into five sections. 
	t: The file describes the variation of each node over time in synthetic networks and real-world networks 
	Sensitivity: This file describes the sensitivity analysis for different parameters, including  , and  .
	threshold: This file describe the effect of different parameters on the green behavior threshold, including  , and  .	m : Influence of nodal activity heterogeneity on green behavior 
            diffusion
	gamma: Influence of contact capacity on green behavior diffusion
